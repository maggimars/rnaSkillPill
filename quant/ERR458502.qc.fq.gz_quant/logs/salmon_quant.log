[2019-12-11 12:26:20.489] [jointLog] [info] Counted 1,737,216 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-12-11 12:26:20.496] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000161953% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
